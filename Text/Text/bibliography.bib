Abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is making a significant impact in the consumer credit and investment community around the world. However, because of uncertainties surrounding the regulation of P2P lending in Hong Kong, it remains in its infancy and market players have not stepped up to address the growing consumer credit need. This article looks at the potential regulations which might apply to P2P players in Hong Kong operating the two most common P2P lending models: the notary and the client segregated account model. This article then briefly proposes a possible way for Hong Kong to regulate the activity in the future, bearing in mind the need to protect borrowers and lenders. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Abstract = {The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act called for a government study of the regulatory options for on-line Peer-to-Peer lending. On-line P2P sites, most notably for-profit sites Prosper.com and LendingClub.com, offer individual "investors" the chance to lend funds to individual "borrowers." The sites promise lower interest rates for borrowers and high rates of return for investors. In addition to the media attention such sites have generated, they also raise significant regulatory concerns on both the state and federal level. The Government Accountability Office report produced in response to the Dodd-Frank Act failed to make a strong recommendation between two primary regulatory options--a multi-faceted regulatory approach in which different federal and state agencies would exercise authority over different aspects of on-line P2P lending, or a single-regulator approach, in which a single agency (most likely the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) wou},

The demand for short-term funding has spurred the quest for a substitute, an effort encouraged and supported by regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In this paper, we evaluate the potential for online peer-to-peer markets to provide this alternative. We conclude that while certain features of peer-to-peer loans would be well suited (such as their longer terms, larger amounts, and multiple payments), the longer time to fund and the required minimum credit scores for borrowers present meaningful hurdles.},

In this study we answer these questions by comparing P2P lending with the nonconstruction consumer credit market in Germany. We show that P2P lending is servicing a slice of the consumer credit market neglected by banks, namely highrisk and small-sized loans. Nevertheless, when accounting for the risk differential, interest rates are very similar. Our conclusion is that P2P lending is substituting the banking sector for high-risk consumer loans since banks are unwilling or unable to supply this slice of the market. Our study serves to show where the institutionalization of credit provision has left a slice of the market unsupplied.},

We study herding behavior, defined as a greater likelihood of bidding in auctions with more existing bids, in P2P loan auctions on Prosper.com. The results of an empirical study provide evidence of strategic herding behavior by lenders such that they have a greater likelihood of bidding on an auction with more bids (a 1% increase in the number of bids increases the likelihood of an additional bid by 15%), but only to the point at which it has received full funding. After this point, herding diminishes (a 1% increase in bids increases the likelihood of an additional bid by only 5%). We also find a positive association between herding in the loan auction and its subsequent performance, that is, whether borrowers pay the money back on time. Unlike eBay auctions where herding impacts bidders adversely, our findings reveal that strategic herding behavior in P2P loan auctions benefits bidders, individually and collectively."

Peer-to-peer lending markets bring together noninstitutional borrowers and lenders. In a typical lending market, borrowers have to present their projects, and lenders decide under what terms they are prepared to provide the requested capital. As many loans are not secured by collateral, the assessment of the creditworthiness of the borrower is the most important task. We demonstrate that investors fail to transform the available information into proper market activities in the absence of hard, quantifiable banking data, threatening the sustainability of this new lending concept. We present a decision-support-tool to support users in the estimation of risk of default. Based on an a-posteriori analysis, we demonstrate that our system is able to price the risk of default adequately and is able to improve investors' return significantly."

To answer this question, I use real-life investment data collected at the largest German market for peer-to-peer lending. Investors' utility is assumed to be a function of the projects expected return and its standard deviation, whereas standard deviation serves as a measure of risk. Gender differences regarding the responses to projects' risk are tested by estimating a random parameter regression model that allows for variation of risk preferences across investors. Estimation results provide no evidence of gender differences in investors' risk propensity: On average, male and female investors respond similarly to the changes in the standard deviation of expected return. Moreover, no differences between male and female investors are found with respect to other characteristics of projects that may serve as a proxy for projects' risk. Significant gender differences in investors' tastes are found only with respect to preferred investment duration, purpose of investment project and borrowers' age.},

A key challenge for personal investors in P2P lending marketplaces is the effective allocation of their money across different loans by accurately assessing the credit risk of each loan. Traditional rating-based assessment models cannot meet the needs of individual investors in P2P lending, since they do not provide an explicit mechanism for asset allocation. In this study, we propose a data-driven investment decision-making framework for this emerging market. We designed an instance-based credit risk assessment model, which has the ability of evaluating the return and risk of each individual loan. Moreover, we formulated the investment decision in P2P lending as a portfolio optimization problem with boundary constraints. To validate the proposed model, we performed extensive experiments on real-world datasets from two notable P2P lending marketplaces. Experimental results revealed that the proposed model can effectively improve investment performances compared with existing methods in P2P lending."

It demonstrates that the traditional approach of portfolio management theory, which states that investments in stocks are preferable over bonds in terms of their long-run risk–return trade-offs, is by no means always consistent with empirical evidence. This article proves the opposite, i.e., that for long-term investors, investments in corporate bonds are more profitable in terms of the risk–return ratio than investments in stocks, arguing in favor of strategies pursued by pension funds and other institutional investors focused primarily on investments in fixed-income instruments, including infrastructural bonds. Emphasis is placed on the need for regular adjustments to long-term investors’ portfolios. As portfolios get older, those investors see a reduction in the returns’ dispersion, while differences in risk between various portfolios increase. This means that to maintain a fixed risk–return ratio for a portfolio as the horizon increases, an investor needs to increase the share of lower-risk financial assets during asset allocation process. This thesis becomes especially relevant in the context of retirement savings management."
