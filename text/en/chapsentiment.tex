\section{Sentiment Analysis}
\label{chap:sent}
As stated in \citep{Veselovska}: "Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is an automatic detection of a positive or negative polarity, or neutrality of ... a text sequence", which is exactly as the sentiment analysis is understood in this work, although there are some other definitions consisting of e.g. opinion extraction, irony or stance \citep{Montoyo2012}. Another tasks related to sentiment analysis is a subjectivity analysis (whether the presented opinion is objective or highly subjective), which is also not included in this work, mainly because the lack of labelled data for Czech. It is possible to analyze individual expressions, sentences or whole documents \citep{Veselovska} and this work focuses on the document level classification.
\subsection{Task definition}
\paragraph{Sentiment analysis} \mbox{}\\
\textit{input:} sequence of sentences (a whole post or comment, depending on the source) \\
\textit{output:} prevailing sentiment of the input from categories: neutral, positive, negative.
\par

\paragraph{Metric} For evaluating performance, two metrics are used: macro-averaged F1 score and accuracy. Both metrics are chosen for better comparability with previous work.

\citep{Libovicky} presents state-of-the art results in three czech NLP tasks including sentiment analysis. They use only CSFD dataset with resulting accuracy 80.8 .1 which is still not so good as Brychcín (81.5.3). The second mentioned paper, however, uses quite complicated method for classification incorporating the fact of which movie is reviewed.

results are accuracy 84 with tfidf and about 81 with bert and they used mall dataset.

\subsection{Dataset and Preprocessing}
%TODO zjistit jaka jsou na to porovnavaci data This work primary tries to improve existing tasks and show the ability of contextualized embeddings to improve results, so tasks with existing data and results were selected.  %TODO why?
Four main Czech datasets with sentiment annotation are available: user reviews from MALL.cz (mall), film reviews from csfd.cz (csfd), news from Aktualne.cz (aktualne) and posts from czech branch pages on facebook.cz (facebook). As \textit{aktualne} dataset turned out to be problematical because the text were ambiguous even for annotators, and its authors later used other mentioned datasets \citep{Veselovska}, this work also focuses only on the three other data sources -- \textit{mall}, \textit{csfd} and \textit{facebook} \footnote{All three datasets are all available here: http://liks.fav.zcu.cz/sentiment/}. Some experiment are also performed with in-domain training on Eglish data. For this purpose is used \textit{imdb} dataset \footnote{https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imdb\_reviews}, which contains movie review from the biggest movie rating website imdb.com. This leads to some problems described later in this section, because English dataset contains only binary classification (positive/negative). Table \ref{tab:datasets} summarize each dataset.

shows, that the resulting dataset is highly unbalanced, which causes divergence and stuck in training. Due to the big part of labels being positive, many learning strategies just ended with predicting only \textit{positive} class, i.e. 55\% accuracy, so unfortunately learned nothing. 

%This was the the case for following experiments settings:
%learning rate of $2e-3$ for 10 epochs. This ended with predicting only one class (positive). Some progress showed the followign approach:"2:5e-5,1:2e-5, unfreezed" for facebook data only (which are balanced). This results are above 71 for accuracy (Test accuracy: 0.726
%F1 metrics: 0.7077061630227595 weighted).


\subsection{Experiments and Architecture}
The main division of experiments is by the input dataset -- each of Czech models separately and one joint dataset consisting of all Czech datasets, i.e. four different datasets. All variants performed both layers attention and an average of last four layers. As for the learning rate, all experiments were made with learning rate $3 \times 10^{-5}$ and there were always two types of learning rate decay -- cosine and inverse square root decay. 
\par
Network architecture is much simpler than in tagging and lemmatization task and corresponds to \textit{simple} setting of these tasks -- only BERT-like model and classification head consisting of layer with softmax activation function. %TODO a neni tam nahodou jeste neco?

\subsection{Results}

%Because BERT model was trained on multilingual data, it is naturally not so good in language minoritly presented in the Bert's training data. When transfering the learned knowledge to czech sentiment task, we actually want to improve model in two ways: teach it something more specific about given task, i.e., sentiment, and improve its knowledge about selected language (czech in this case). By using czech sentiment dataset, both thing are incorporated into training. To obtained better results and following the \citep{Putra}, I also selected english sentiment dataset. The idea behind is that BERT is quite good in english and maybe can learn faster useful knowledge about the given task from data in more familiar language.
