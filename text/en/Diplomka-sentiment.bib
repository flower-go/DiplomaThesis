abstract = {Compared to English, the amount of labeled data for Indonesian text classification tasks is very small. Recently developed multilingual language models have shown its ability to create multilingual representations effectively. This paper investigates the effect of combining English and Indonesian data on building Indonesian text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis and hate speech) using multilingual language models. Using the feature-based approach, we observe its performance on various data sizes and total added English data. The experiment showed that the addition of English data, especially if the amount of Indonesian data is small, improves performance. Using the fine-tuning approach, we further showed its effectiveness in utilizing the English language to build Indonesian text classification models.},

abstract = {In the area of online communication, commerce and transactions, analyzing sentiment polarity of texts written in various natural languages has become crucial. While there have been a lot of contributions in resources and studies for the English language, "smaller" languages like Czech have not received much attention. In this survey, we explore the effectiveness of many existing machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis of Czech Facebook posts and product reviews. We report the sets of optimal parameter values for each algorithm and the scores in both datasets. We finally observe that support vector machines are the best classifier and efforts to increase performance even more with bagging, boosting or voting ensemble schemes fail to do so.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a wide area with great potential and many research directions. One direction is stance detection, which is somewhat similar to sentiment analysis. We supplement stance detection dataset with sentiment annotation and explore the similarities of these tasks. We show that stance detection and sentiment analysis can be mutually beneficial by using gold label for one task as features for the other task. We analysed the presence of target entities for stance detection in the dataset. We outperform the state-of-the-art results for stance detection in Czech and set new state-of-the-art results for the newly created sentiment analysis part of the extended dataset.},

@techreport{Libovicky,
abstract = {In this work, we focus on three different NLP tasks: image captioning, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. We reimplement successful approaches of other authors and adapt them to the Czech language. We provide end-to-end architectures that achieve state-of-the-art or nearly state-of-the-art results on all of the tasks within a single sequence learning toolkit. The trained models are available both for download as well as in an online demo. 1 End-to-End Training Traditionally, solving tasks such as machine translation or sentiment analysis required complex processing pipelines consisting of tools which transformed one explicit representation of the data into another, with the structure of the internal representations defined by the system designer. In machine translation [24, 6], we would devise explicit word alignment links, extract phrase tables, train a language model, etc.; in sentiment analysis [32, 43], we could label the data with part-of-speech tags, decode their syntactic structure, and/or assign them with semantic labels. All of these more-or-less linguistically motivated internal representations are not inherently required to produce the desired output, but have been devised as clever and useful ways to break down the large and hard task into smaller and manageable substeps. With the advent of end-to-end training of deep neural networks (DNN) [26, 14, 28], the need for most of this has been eliminated. In the end-to-end learning paradigm, there is only one model, directly trained to produce the desired outputs from the inputs, without any explicit intermediate representations. The system designer now only has to design a rather generic architecture of the system. It mostly does not enforce any complex explicit representations and processing steps, but rather offers opportunities for the DNN to devise its own notion of intermediate representations and processing steps through training. This also means that similar architectures can be used to solve very different tasks. Rather than by the nature of the task itself, the structure of the DNN to use is mostly determined by the structure of the input and output -e.g. image inputs are processed by two-dimensional convolutions [27], while text inputs are processed by one-dimensional convolutions, recurrent units [38], and/or attentions [3], typically applied to word or subword embed-dings [5, 10, 33]; classification can produce its output in one step, while text generation is better done iteratively using recurrent decoders; etc. Thanks to that, a single general framework can be used to solve many different tasks. One just needs to transform the inputs and outputs into a suitable format, define an adequate network structure, and let the system train for a few days or weeks. Sadly, the burden of hyperparameter tuning has not been alleviated by DNNs, but rather made worse by the computational costliness of the training. However, with a bit of experience, one is often able to propose a suitable architecture and hyperparameter values at the first attempt, already achieving very competitive results even without any further tuning.},

@inproceedings{Montoyo2012,
abstract = {In this introduction, we present an overview of the current state of research in the Natural Language Processing tasks of subjectivity and sentiment analysis, as well as their application domains and closely-related research field of emotion detection. Although many definitions exist for these tasks and the research done within their frame spans over approaches with different objectives, we consider subjectivity analysis to deal with the detection of "private states" (opinions, emotions, sentiments, beliefs, speculations) and sentiment analysis as the task of detecting, extracting and classifying opinions and sentiments concerning different topics, as expressed in textual input. After describing the key concepts and research directions in these tasks, we present the main achievements obtained so far and the issues that remain to be tackled. Subsequently, we introduce each of the papers in this volume and present their contribution to the research areas of subjectivity and sentiment analysis. Finally, we conclude on the present state of work in these fields and reflect on the possible future developments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@techreport{Li,
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the modeling power of contextualized embeddings from pre-trained language models, e.g. BERT, on the E2E-ABSA task. Specifically, we build a series of simple yet insightful neural base-lines to deal with E2E-ABSA. The experimental results show that even with a simple linear classification layer, our BERT-based architecture can outperform state-of-the-art works. Besides, we also standardize the comparative study by consistently utilizing a hold-out development dataset for model selection, which is largely ignored by previous works. Therefore , our work can serve as a BERT-based benchmark for E2E-ABSA. 1},
