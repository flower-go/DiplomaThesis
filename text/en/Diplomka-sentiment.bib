abstract = {Instructions Sentiment analysis is an approach that aims to extract the polarity of a given text. Such polarity may, for example, correspond to a positive or negative review of some product. The aim of this work is to review and apply state of the art methods of sentiment analysis on product reviews in the Czech language. 1) Review and theoretically describe state of the art approaches for sentiment analysis. Focus on the various representations of words/documents like tf-idf or vector representations of words. 2) Use or implement at least two of the reviewed methods and experimentally compare their performance on reviews in the Czech language. Avoid implementing anew those methods that can be easily taken over from available implementations. 3) Propose a direction for further improvement of selected approaches. References Will be provided by the supervisor.},

abstract = {In the area of online communication, commerce and transactions, analyzing sentiment polarity of texts written in various natural languages has become crucial. While there have been a lot of contributions in resources and studies for the English language, "smaller" languages like Czech have not received much attention. In this survey, we explore the effectiveness of many existing machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis of Czech Facebook posts and product reviews. We report the sets of optimal parameter values for each algorithm and the scores in both datasets. We finally observe that support vector machines are the best classifier and efforts to increase performance even more with bagging, boosting or voting ensemble schemes fail to do so.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a wide area with great potential and many research directions. One direction is stance detection, which is somewhat similar to sentiment analysis. We supplement stance detection dataset with sentiment annotation and explore the similarities of these tasks. We show that stance detection and sentiment analysis can be mutually beneficial by using gold label for one task as features for the other task. We analysed the presence of target entities for stance detection in the dataset. We outperform the state-of-the-art results for stance detection in Czech and set new state-of-the-art results for the newly created sentiment analysis part of the extended dataset.},

@inproceedings{Libovicky,
abstract = {In this work, we focus on three different NLP tasks: image captioning, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. We reimplement successful approaches of other authors and adapt them to the Czech language. We provide end-to-end architectures that achieve state-of-the-art or nearly state-of-the-art results on all of the tasks within a single sequence learning toolkit. The trained models are available both for download as well as in an online demo. 1 End-to-End Training Traditionally, solving tasks such as machine translation or sentiment analysis required complex processing pipelines consisting of tools which transformed one explicit representation of the data into another, with the structure of the internal representations defined by the system designer. In machine translation [24, 6], we would devise explicit word alignment links, extract phrase tables, train a language model, etc.; in sentiment analysis [32, 43], we could label the data with part-of-speech tags, decode their syntactic structure, and/or assign them with semantic labels. All of these more-or-less linguistically motivated internal representations are not inherently required to produce the desired output, but have been devised as clever and useful ways to break down the large and hard task into smaller and manageable substeps. With the advent of end-to-end training of deep neural networks (DNN) [26, 14, 28], the need for most of this has been eliminated. In the end-to-end learning paradigm, there is only one model, directly trained to produce the desired outputs from the inputs, without any explicit intermediate representations. The system designer now only has to design a rather generic architecture of the system. It mostly does not enforce any complex explicit representations and processing steps, but rather offers opportunities for the DNN to devise its own notion of intermediate representations and processing steps through training. This also means that similar architectures can be used to solve very different tasks. Rather than by the nature of the task itself, the structure of the DNN to use is mostly determined by the structure of the input and output -e.g. image inputs are processed by two-dimensional convolutions [27], while text inputs are processed by one-dimensional convolutions, recurrent units [38], and/or attentions [3], typically applied to word or subword embed-dings [5, 10, 33]; classification can produce its output in one step, while text generation is better done iteratively using recurrent decoders; etc. Thanks to that, a single general framework can be used to solve many different tasks. One just needs to transform the inputs and outputs into a suitable format, define an adequate network structure, and let the system train for a few days or weeks. Sadly, the burden of hyperparameter tuning has not been alleviated by DNNs, but rather made worse by the computational costliness of the training. However, with a bit of experience, one is often able to propose a suitable architecture and hyperparameter values at the first attempt, already achieving very competitive results even without any further tuning.},

abstract = {The paper investigates a problem connected with automatic analysis of sentiment (opinion) in textual natural-language documents. The initial situation works on the assumption that a user has many documents centered around a certain topic with different opinions of it. The user wants to pick out only relevant documents that represent a certain sentiment-for example, only positive reviews of a certain subject. Having not too many typical patterns of the desired document type, the user needs a tool that can collect documents which are similar to the patterns. The suggested procedure is based on computing the similarity degree between patterns and unlabeled documents, which are then ranked according to their similarity to the patterns. The similarity is calculated as a distance between patterns and unlabeled items. The results are shown for publicly accessible down-loaded real-world data in two languages, English and Czech.},

Specifically, we build a series of simple yet insightful neural base-lines to deal with E2E-ABSA. The experimental results show that even with a simple linear classification layer, our BERT-based architecture can outperform state-of-the-art works. Besides, we also standardize the comparative study by consistently utilizing a hold-out development dataset for model selection, which is largely ignored by previous works. Therefore , our work can serve as a BERT-based benchmark for E2E-ABSA. 1},

embedding by introducing self-attention. Instead of using a vector, we use a
2-D matrix to represent the embedding, with each row of the matrix attending on

and a special regularization term for the model. As a side effect, the
embedding comes with an easy way of visualizing what specific parts of the
sentence are encoded into the embedding. We evaluate our model on 3 different
tasks: author profiling, sentiment classification, and textual entailment.
Results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to
other sentence embedding methods in all of the 3 tasks.},
