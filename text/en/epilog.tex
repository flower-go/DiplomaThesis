In this thesis, we implemented Czech \acrlong{pos} tagging, lemmatization and sentiment analysis with the usage of \acrlong{bert}-like architectures. We achieved \acrlong{sota} results in tagging (accuracy 98.57\%) and lemmatization (accuracy 99.00\%) and joint accuracy of these two tasks 98.19\%, which presents the error reduction of 67\% for tagging accuracy and 53\% for lemmatization accuracy compared to previous public model \citep{Strakova}\footnote{The best publicly available model is to our best knowledge available at \url{https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita/users-manual\#czech-morfflex-pdt_model}. and has 95.55\% tagging and 97.96\% lemmatization accuracy.} We also presents new \acrlong{sota} results in sentiment analysis on all three used datasets -- \textit{mall}, \textit{csfd}, \textit{facebook}. We also explored various training techniques and showed the good performance of static embeddings compared to any further training of BERT models. This thesis also examines types of errors BERT helps to solve. All code, text and best models are publicly available on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/flower-go/DiplomaThesis}.
