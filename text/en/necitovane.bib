abstract = {In this work, we propose Attentive Pooling (AP), a two-way attention mechanism for discriminative model training. In the context of pair-wise ranking or classification with neural networks, AP enables the pooling layer to be aware of the current input pair, in a way that information from the two input items can directly influence the computation of each other's representations. Along with such representations of the paired inputs, AP jointly learns a similarity measure over projected segments (e.g. trigrams) of the pair, and subsequently, derives the corresponding attention vector for each input to guide the pooling. Our two-way attention mechanism is a general framework independent of the underlying representation learning, and it has been applied to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in our studies. The empirical results, from three very different benchmark tasks of question answering/answer selection, demonstrate that our proposed models outperform a variety of strong baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance in all the benchmarks.},

abstract = {Bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) networks have recently proven successful for various NLP sequence mod-eling tasks, but little is known about their reliance to input representations, target languages, data set size, and label noise. We address these issues and evaluate bi-LSTMs with word, character, and unicode byte embeddings for POS tagging. We compare bi-LSTMs to traditional POS taggers across languages and data sizes. We also present a novel bi-LSTM model, which combines the POS tagging loss function with an auxiliary loss function that accounts for rare words. The model obtains state-of-the-art performance across 22 languages, and works especially well for morphologically complex languages. Our analysis suggests that bi-LSTMs are less sensitive to training data size and label corruptions (at small noise levels) than previously assumed.},

@article{Clark2020,
abstract = {Masked language modeling (MLM) pre-training methods such as BERT corrupt the input by replacing some tokens with [MASK] and then train a model to reconstruct the original tokens. While they produce good results when transferred to downstream NLP tasks, they generally require large amounts of compute to be effective. As an alternative, we propose a more sample-efficient pre-training task called replaced token detection. Instead of masking the input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out. As a result, the contextual representations learned by our approach substantially outperform the ones learned by BERT given the same model size, data, and compute. The gains are particularly strong for small models; for example, we train a model on one GPU for 4 days that outperforms GPT (trained using 30x more compute) on the GLUE natural language understanding benchmark. Our approach also works well at scale, where it performs comparably to RoBERTa and XLNet while using less than 1/4 of their compute and outperforms them when using the same amount of compute.},

abstract = {Multilingual BERT (mBERT) trained on 104 languages has shown surprisingly good cross-lingual performance on several NLP tasks, even without explicit cross-lingual signals. However, these evaluations have focused on cross-lingual transfer with high-resource languages, covering only a third of the languages covered by mBERT. We explore how mBERT performs on a much wider set of languages, focusing on the quality of representation for low-resource languages, measured by within-language performance. We consider three tasks: Named Entity Recognition (99 languages), Part-of-speech Tagging, and Dependency Parsing (54 languages each). mBERT does better than or comparable to baselines on high resource languages but does much worse for low resource languages. Furthermore, monolingual BERT models for these languages do even worse. Paired with similar languages, the performance gap between monolingual BERT and mBERT can be narrowed. We find that better models for low resource languages require more efficient pretraining techniques or more data.},

However, there exist several multilingual BERT models that can handle multiple languages simultaneously and that have been trained also on Estonian data. In this paper, we evaluate four multilingual models---multilingual BERT, multilingual distilled BERT, XLM and XLM-RoBERTa---on several NLP tasks including POS and morphological tagging, NER and text classification. Our aim is to establish a comparison between these multilingual BERT models and the existing baseline neural models for these tasks. Our results show that multilingual BERT models can generalise well on different Estonian NLP tasks outperforming all baselines models for POS and morphological tagging and text classification, and reaching the comparable level with the best baseline for NER, with XLM-RoBERTa achieving the highest results compared with other multilingual models.},

@inproceedings{Libovicky,
abstract = {In this work, we focus on three different NLP tasks: image captioning, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. We reimplement successful approaches of other authors and adapt them to the Czech language. We provide end-to-end architectures that achieve state-of-the-art or nearly state-of-the-art results on all of the tasks within a single sequence learning toolkit. The trained models are available both for download as well as in an online demo. 1 End-to-End Training Traditionally, solving tasks such as machine translation or sentiment analysis required complex processing pipelines consisting of tools which transformed one explicit representation of the data into another, with the structure of the internal representations defined by the system designer. In machine translation [24, 6], we would devise explicit word alignment links, extract phrase tables, train a language model, etc.; in sentiment analysis [32, 43], we could label the data with part-of-speech tags, decode their syntactic structure, and/or assign them with semantic labels. All of these more-or-less linguistically motivated internal representations are not inherently required to produce the desired output, but have been devised as clever and useful ways to break down the large and hard task into smaller and manageable substeps. With the advent of end-to-end training of deep neural networks (DNN) [26, 14, 28], the need for most of this has been eliminated. In the end-to-end learning paradigm, there is only one model, directly trained to produce the desired outputs from the inputs, without any explicit intermediate representations. The system designer now only has to design a rather generic architecture of the system. It mostly does not enforce any complex explicit representations and processing steps, but rather offers opportunities for the DNN to devise its own notion of intermediate representations and processing steps through training. This also means that similar architectures can be used to solve very different tasks. Rather than by the nature of the task itself, the structure of the DNN to use is mostly determined by the structure of the input and output -e.g. image inputs are processed by two-dimensional convolutions [27], while text inputs are processed by one-dimensional convolutions, recurrent units [38], and/or attentions [3], typically applied to word or subword embed-dings [5, 10, 33]; classification can produce its output in one step, while text generation is better done iteratively using recurrent decoders; etc. Thanks to that, a single general framework can be used to solve many different tasks. One just needs to transform the inputs and outputs into a suitable format, define an adequate network structure, and let the system train for a few days or weeks. Sadly, the burden of hyperparameter tuning has not been alleviated by DNNs, but rather made worse by the computational costliness of the training. However, with a bit of experience, one is often able to propose a suitable architecture and hyperparameter values at the first attempt, already achieving very competitive results even without any further tuning.},

abstract = {Deep learning-based language models pretrained on large unannotated text corpora have been demonstrated to allow efficient transfer learning for natural language processing, with recent approaches such as the transformer-based BERT model advancing the state of the art across a variety of tasks. While most work on these models has focused on high-resource languages, in particular English, a number of recent efforts have introduced multilingual models that can be fine-tuned to address tasks in a large number of different languages. However, we still lack a thorough understanding of the capabilities of these models, in particular for lower-resourced languages. In this paper, we focus on Finnish and thoroughly evaluate the multilingual BERT model on a range of tasks, comparing it with a new Finnish BERT model trained from scratch. The new language-specific model is shown to systematically and clearly outperform the multilingual. While the multilingual model largely fails to reach the performance of previously proposed methods, the custom Finnish BERT model establishes new state-of-the-art results on all corpora for all reference tasks: part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing. We release the model and all related resources created for this study with open licenses at https://turkunlp.org/finbert .},

@article{Liu2019,
abstract = {Language model pretraining has led to significant performance gains but careful comparison between different approaches is challenging. Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code.},

As our first improvement, we use the pre-trained contextualized embeddings (BERT) as additional inputs to the network; secondly, we use individual morphological features as reg-ularization; and finally, we merge the selected corpora of the same language. In the lemmatization task, our system exceeds all the submitted systems by a wide margin with lemmatization accuracy 95.78 (second best was 95.00, third 94.46). In the morphological analysis, our system placed tightly second: our morphological analysis accuracy was 93.19, the winning system's 93.23.},

abstract = {Statistical modeling is now the prevailing method using in automatic procedures of analysis of a natural language. Such an analysis can be performed at various levels, from phonetics to semantics. Two levels of representation are described: a morphological one and a syntactic one that is further subdivided into a surface syntax and deep syntax (tectogrammatics). The role of linguistically annotated corpora will be stressed as a necessary prerequisite for any supervised machine learning algorithms, showing examples from the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) being developed at Charles University, Prague. A possible application of some of the tools created during (and thanks to) the development of the PDT will be shown, namely, a machine translation system translating from Czech to Slovak.},

abstract = {UDPipe is a trainable pipeline which performs sentence segmentation, tokeniza-tion, POS tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing (Straka et al., 2016). We present a prototype for UDPipe 2.0 and evaluate it in the CoNLL 2018 UD Shared Task: Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies, which employs three metrics for submission ranking. Out of 26 participants, the prototype placed first in the MLAS ranking, third in the LAS ranking and third in the BLEX ranking. In extrinsic parser evaluation EPE 2018, the system ranked first in the overall score. The prototype utilizes an artificial neu-ral network with a single joint model for POS tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing, and is trained only using the CoNLL-U training data and pretrained word embeddings, contrary to both systems surpassing the prototype in the LAS and BLEX ranking in the shared task. The open-source code of the prototype is available at http://github.com/ CoNLL-UD-2018/UDPipe-Future. After the shared task, we slightly refined the model architecture, resulting in better performance both in the intrinsic evaluation (corresponding to first, second and second rank in MLAS, LAS and BLEX shared task metrics) and the extrinsic evaluation. The improved models will be available shortly in UDPipe at},

We replicate this study using a fresh collection of 27 corpora of 21 languages that are annotated with fine-grained tagsets of varying size. Our replication confirms the result in general , and we additionally find that the advantage of LSTMs is even bigger for larger tagsets. However, we also find that for the very large tagsets of morphologically rich languages, hand-crafted morphological lexicons are still necessary to reach state-of-the-art performance.},
