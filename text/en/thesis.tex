Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Milan Straka, for answering even the dumbest questions with patience and kindness, helping me to debug tricky errors as well as the obvious ones, and always being cheerful and full of enthusiasm. I learned so much during the work on this thesis. \\
This thesis would not exists without my loving husband and his continuous support. I would also like to thank my s[o/u]n, who didn't let me program all day without interruption and go crazy. \\
I could never start studying without my mom and grandma, who raised me and gave me the best. \\
Last but not least, Thank God, who created such a beautiful world.\\ \\
P.S.: My husband wants me to write here that he is amazing (and he truly is).

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{
With the increasing amount of digital data in the form of unstructured text, the importance of natural language processing (NLP) increases. The most successful technologies of recent years are deep neural networks. This work applies the state-of-the-art methods, namely transfer learning of Bidirectional Encoders Representations from Transformers (BERT), on three Czech NLP tasks: part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization and sentiment analysis. We applied BERT model with a simple classification head on three Czech sentiment datasets: mall, facebook, and csfd, and we achieved state-of-the-art results. We also explored several possible architectures for tagging and lemmatization and obtained new state-of-the-art results in both tagging and lemmatization with fine-tunning approach on data from Prague Dependency Treebank. Specifically, we achieved accuracy 98.57\% for tagging, 99.00\% for lemmatization, and 98.19\%  for joint accuracy of both tasks. Best models for all tasks are publicly available.
